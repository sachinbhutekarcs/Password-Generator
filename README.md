# Password-Generator
This program generates a strong password with combination of letters, numbers and symbols based on user input.

1. How many letters would you like in your password?
2. How many symbols would you like?
3. How many numbers would you like?

Then based on user input it returns a strong password with randomly selected letters, numbers and special symbols as specified by user.

For demo, fork the repo and run main.py using any Python IDE.
